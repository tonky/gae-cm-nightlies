CyanogenMod nightlies changelog.

i got tired of manually checking cm nightly builds agains merged commits in
gerrit, so i wrote a python script to do that for me. then i decided to make it
web based, so other people could check it, and as an excercise to get familiar
with google appengine.

this is it :) it lives at http://cm-nightlies.appspot.com

feedback is welcome.
